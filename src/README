Strategies design:
i decided to use decorator as the solution for the multiple strategies. it reminded me the problem of the
pizzas in the lab. every time a brick is hit, the onCollideEnter function will do the extra strategy and then
the strategy of the current object. Also, when the extra strategy is null, the default strategy is activated,
that because the brick must disappear for every collision.
I felt like its a lot easier and more readable to design the strategies this way then to use a very large
inheritance tree which will include a different class to each possible strategy combination.

I managed the strategies amount and probability distribution in a function called createCollisionStrategy and
some helpers for each strategy. The one to talk about is the double strategy helper which calls
createCollisionStrategy with recursion. in order not to call double more then twice i added a variable that
counts the amount of times double is called and managed the recursion calls accordingly. all i needed to do is
to pass another variable that represent how many strategies are available and i orginized the enum in a way
that regular is last and double is second last. so when 6 is passed all strategies are available, but if 4 is
passed for example all strategies are available but the double and regular - as needed when double was choosen
 twice already.


class Ball:
added a new constructor with another parameter - Counter.
    the counter, counts the number of collisions the ball did, in order to exit the special camera mode.

ExtraBall:
i have decided to create a extraBall extends Ball class for the mock ball. I did it because the mock ball has
a very similar behaviour as the main ball, with the exception of what it does when it leaves the screen.

ExtraPaddle:
I have decided to create a new class that extends Paddle for the extra paddle. I did it because the extra
paddle has a very similar behaviour as the main paddle, with the exception of that it has to count the
collisions in order to delete it in time.

GraphicLifeCounter:
added another constructor in order to receive the maximum number of lives the player can achieve, i think it
should be in the game rules and not in the GraphicLifeCounter, if no number is entered the default is 4 as
described in the assignment.
